      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – they do not measure voltage.",
        "b": "Incorrect – they insulate, not conduct.",
        "c": "Correct – their role is both mechanical and electrical.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – not the main cause.",
        "b": "Correct – due to mutual and stray capacitance.",
