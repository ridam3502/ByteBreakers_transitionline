      "question": "What does the reflection coefficient (Γ) represent?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The ratio of input to output voltage",
        "b": "The amount of signal loss",
        "c": "The ratio of reflected to incident voltage",
        "d": "The power transferred to the load"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – this describes gain or attenuation.",
        "b": "Incorrect – return loss represents signal loss.",
        "c": "Correct – Γ = V_reflected / V_incident.",
        "d": "Incorrect – Γ does not represent power transfer."

      "question": "What does a VSWR of 1 indicate?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Maximum reflection",
        "b": "Short circuit condition",
        "c": "Perfect impedance matching",
        "d": "Open circuit condition"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – reflection is zero when VSWR = 1.",
        "b": "Incorrect – short circuits lead to infinite VSWR.",
        "c": "Correct – means Z_L = Z_0.",
        "d": "Incorrect – open circuits also lead to high VSWR."

    {
      "question": "Why do standing waves occur on a transmission line?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Due to power loss in the line",
        "b": "Due to reflections from impedance mismatch",
        "c": "Due to temperature variations",
        "d": "Due to signal amplification"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – loss causes attenuation, not standing waves.",
        "b": "Correct – reflections cause wave interference.",
        "c": "Incorrect – temperature has negligible effect.",
        "d": "Incorrect – amplification doesn’t cause standing waves."

        "a": "Incorrect – Ohm is a unit of resistance.",
        "b": "Incorrect – Power is measured in watts.",
        "c": "Correct – Return loss is in decibels.",
        "d": "Incorrect – Volts measure potential."
