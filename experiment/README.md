# Reflection Coefficient & Impedance Matching Simulator

Welcome to the "Reflection Coefficient & Impedance Matching Simulator" virtual experiment. This experiment is designed to help students and professionals understand the impact of impedance mismatches on transmission lines and the resulting signal reflections, voltage standing waves, and power losses. It provides a hands-on, interactive simulation environment to visualize and analyze key RF transmission line parameters such as the reflection coefficient, VSWR, return loss, and input impedance.

## Objective

To study and simulate the behavior of a transmission line under various load conditions, and to compute and visualize the following:
- Reflection Coefficient (Γ)
- Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR)
- Return Loss (RL)
- Input Impedance (Z_in)
- Standing wave patterns along the transmission line

---

## Target Audience

- Undergraduate and postgraduate students of Electrical, Electronics, and Communication Engineering
- Learners studying RF and microwave engineering, signal transmission, or high-speed PCB design
- Engineers and educators seeking interactive tools for teaching or training purposes

---

## Key Features

- Graphical visualization of voltage standing wave patterns
- Real-time computation of Γ, VSWR, RL, and Z_in
- Parametric input for characteristic impedance, load impedance, line length, and frequency
- Optional self-estimation feature for conceptual reinforcement
- Results history and comparison feature for learning analytics

## Simulation Workflow

1. **Input Parameters**: Choose characteristic impedance, load impedance (real and imaginary), line length, frequency, and velocity factor.
2. **Run Simulation**: View real-time calculated parameters and voltage wave plots.
3. **Analyze Output**: Compare results across different configurations using the analytics panel.
4. **Experiment**: Try different combinations of parameters to observe effects on signal reflections and matching.
5. **Learning Check**: Take pre- and post-tests to evaluate understanding.
