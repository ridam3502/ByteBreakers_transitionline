### Aim of the Experiment

To study the behavior of transmission lines under impedance mismatch conditions by analyzing the reflection coefficient, VSWR (Voltage Standing Wave Ratio), return loss, and input impedance. This experiment simulates how varying the load impedance, line parameters, and frequency affect the voltage standing wave pattern and energy reflection, thereby helping learners understand impedance matching and transmission line theory.
