### Aim of the experiment

To study the voltage distribution across a string of suspension insulators in a high-voltage transmission system and to evaluate the string efficiency. This experiment helps in understanding the non-uniform distribution of voltage due to stray capacitance and its impact on insulator performance. The goal is to visualize the voltage drop across individual discs and explore methods to achieve a more uniform voltage distribution to enhance system reliability and insulator lifespan.
