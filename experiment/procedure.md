### Procedure

1. **Open the Simulation:** Launch the virtual simulator for the experiment.
step 1: Define Parameters
Number of insulator discs n (e.g., 3, 4, 5, 6)

Total voltage V (e.g., 100 kV)

Capacitance ratio α = C_t / C_d (e.g., 0.1, 0.2)

Step 2: Create Equivalent Circuit
Model each disc as a series capacitor

Add stray capacitances to ground (parallel to each disc)

Use nodal analysis or equivalent circuit design in MATLAB/Simulink or PSCAD

Step 3: Run Simulation
Apply total voltage V across the string

Simulate voltage drop across each disc

Step 4: Display Results
Output:

Voltage across each disc

Graph of voltage vs. disc number

Calculate string efficiency

Step 5: Vary Parameters (Optional)
Change number of discs (n)

Change capacitance ratio (α)

Observe how voltage distribution and string efficiency change

6. Results and Graphs
Table of Voltage Across Each Disc

Plot: Voltage vs. Disc Number

String Efficiency Value

Compare simulation and experimental values.

7. Conclusion
Discuss:

Non-uniform voltage distribution

Maximum stress on bottom disc

Importance of grading rings

Efficiency improvements using different methods

*Repeat with Different Parameters:** Change α or number of discs to study its effect on voltage distribution.
9. **Analyze Results:** Note how voltage uniformity and string efficiency improve with various configuration
