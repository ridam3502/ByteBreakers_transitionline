      "question": "In a 3-disc insulator string, which disc typically experiences the highest voltage?",

        "a": "Top disc",
        "b": "Middle disc",
        "c": "Bottom disc",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – not exposed to maximum stress.",
        "b": "Incorrect – middle disc is intermediate.",
        "c": "Correct – closest to the conductor.",
        "d": "Incorrect – voltage is not equally distributed."

      "question": "How can string efficiency be improved?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "By using more conductor material",
        "b": "By reducing system voltage",
        "c": "By installing grading rings",
        "d": "By shortening insulator strings"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – unrelated to efficiency.",
        "b": "Incorrect – not effective.",
        "c": "Correct – grading rings help redistribute voltage.",
        "d": "Incorrect – may reduce performance."
