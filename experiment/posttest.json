      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – a short circuit reflects all energy.",
        "b": "Incorrect – an open circuit also reflects all energy.",
        "c": "Correct – perfect matching results in Γ = 0.",
        "d": "Incorrect – mismatch still causes reflections."

      "question": "What happens to input impedance when the load is mismatched and the line is a quarter wavelength long?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It matches the load impedance",
        "b": "It becomes infinite",
        "c": "It inverts the impedance",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – matching occurs only if Z_L = Z_0.",
        "b": "Incorrect – not necessarily infinite.",
        "c": "Correct – a quarter-wave transformer inverts Z_L/Z_0.",
        "d": "Incorrect – zero impedance only under specific shorts."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – frequency does not eliminate reflection.",
        "b": "Incorrect – line length does not correct mismatch.",
        "c": "Correct – impedance matching prevents reflections.",
        "d": "Incorrect – adding capacitance could worsen mismatch."

      "question": "What role does the velocity factor play in a transmission line?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It determines power loss",
        "b": "It affects the propagation speed of signals",
        "c": "It sets the characteristic impedance",

      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – power loss is not directly related.",
        "b": "Correct – velocity factor = v_signal / c.",
