## Theory

Transmission lines are used to carry high-frequency signals, such as RF and microwave signals, from one point to another. When these lines are not terminated in their characteristic impedance, part of the signal is reflected back toward the source, causing standing waves and inefficient power transfer.

### 1. Reflection Coefficient (Γ)

Reflection coefficient Γ is a measure of how much of the signal is reflected due to impedance mismatch. It is defined as:

Γ = (Z_L - Z_0) / (Z_L + Z_0)

Where:
- Z_L is the load impedance
- Z_0 is the characteristic impedance of the line

Γ is a complex number representing both magnitude and phase of the reflected signal. A value of Γ = 0 indicates perfect matching.

### 2. Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR)

VSWR quantifies the mismatch and is defined as:

VSWR = (1 + |Γ|) / (1 - |Γ|)

- VSWR = 1 indicates a perfect match.
- Higher VSWR implies greater mismatch.

### 3. Return Loss (RL)

Return Loss measures how much power is reflected back and is expressed in decibels:

RL (dB) = -20 × log₁₀(|Γ|)

A higher return loss means less reflection and better impedance matching.

### 4. Input Impedance (Z_in)

Z_in is the impedance seen at a distance l from the load, defined as:

Z_in = Z_0 × (Z_L + jZ_0 tan(βl)) / (Z_0 + jZ_L tan(βl))

Where β = 2π / λ is the phase constant and l is the line length.

### 5. Standing Wave Pattern

The magnitude of voltage along the line is given by:

|V(d)| = |V_inc| × |1 + Γ × e^(-j2βd)|

This produces standing waves when Γ ≠ 0. These standing waves cause voltage maxima and minima at specific points along the line.

### 6. Impedance Matching

Impedance matching ensures maximum power transfer and eliminates reflections. Methods include:
- Using resistive matching networks
- Adding reactive components (L/C matching)
- Using quarter-wave transformers
- Stub matching techniques

### 7. Applications

- Antenna systems
- High-speed digital signaling
- RF amplifiers and filters
- Microwave transmission lines

Understanding and minimizing reflection is crucial for designing efficient, high-performance communication and signal processing systems.
