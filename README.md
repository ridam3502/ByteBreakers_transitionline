### About the Experiment 

The **Voltage Distribution Across String Insulators** experiment is conducted to study how voltage is distributed across each unit of a string of suspension-type insulators used in high-voltage transmission lines. Ideally, the voltage should be equally shared among all insulator discs; however, due to the presence of stray capacitances—mainly between the metal fittings of the insulators and the tower structure—non-uniform voltage distribution occurs. The disc nearest to the line conductor experiences the highest voltage, while the one closest to the tower experiences the least. This unequal voltage distribution can lead to over-stressing of the lower units, potentially causing premature failure. The experiment helps in analyzing this effect by measuring the voltage across each insulator and calculating the **string efficiency**, which indicates how effectively the insulators are utilized. The findings are important for improving insulator design and applying methods such as grading rings or capacitance grading to ensure more uniform voltage distribution and enhance the reliability of overhead transmission systems.
